# Skill compatibility

A Skill can supply instructions and resources for a callable Markdown method.
Its required environment must also fit the receiving host and Markdown/0 profile.
For a worked adaptation, follow [Bring a Skill](/build/skills).

[Package/0](../spec/package-format.md) and [Markdown/0](../spec/markdown-runtime.md) define the exact requirements.
This page explains the differences that affect current execution.

## Instructions, resources, and context

| Skill material or behavior | Current Markdown/0 behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary instructions | A host-selected Agent interprets them during one finite invocation. |
| `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, string-valued `metadata` | Recognized frontmatter, subject to FLOW validation. Environment prose grants no powers. |
| Referenced text files | Read on demand from captured package-local UTF-8 files, within the interpreter's limits. |
| Bundled scripts | Preserved as files. The interpreter supplies no general shell or script-execution action. |
| Binary assets, workspace editing, arbitrary files, or network access | Required effects need separately supported and authorized implementations. |
| Harness-specific tools and permission patterns | Unsupported `allowed-tools` values prevent invocation. Slots require explicit declarations and host configuration. |
| Conversation history or ongoing interaction | The caller supplies explicit input. The originating Agent session is not implicitly available. |
| Discovery and automatic activation | The host or application owns selection. Renaming an entrypoint does not install a catalogue. |

The [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) leaves execution to the receiving Agent and describes tool pre-approval as experimental.
Preserving files alone cannot supply a missing tool, data source, or enforced restriction.

## Tool restrictions

Markdown/0 enforces `allowed-tools` during execution qualification:

| Value | Available actions |
| --- | --- |
| Omitted | Eligible authored recipes and captured-resource reads, subject to host grants. |
| Empty after trimming ASCII spaces | Reasoning and returning a result. Resource reads and call/send/receive effects are unavailable. |
| Exactly `Read` after that trimming | Captured-resource reads. Call/send/receive effects are unavailable. |
| Any other nonempty value | Whole-invocation qualification fails before reasoning or effects. |

For example, `Bash(git:*) Read` is unsupported by this profile.
`Read` covers captured package-local text, rather than an arbitrary workspace.
Required endpoint settlement remains available under tool restrictions.

The restriction applies even when a particular input would not use the named tool.
Removing it changes the authored declaration and supplies no replacement capability.
A code runtime must also qualify restriction enforcement or report the package execution-unsupported.

## Package differences

A Flow contains exactly one root `FLOW.<ext>` implementation.
For `FLOW.md`, optional metadata belongs in frontmatter, with no root `FLOW.meta.json` beside it.
Optional `FLOW.contract.json` owns input/result schemas, custom outcomes, and ports.

The frontmatter uses a bounded YAML subset.
Duplicate keys, anchors, aliases, explicit tags, merge keys, and unknown top-level metadata prevent execution.
Inert extension fields use the documented `x-<name>` form.
Package/0 also defines valid paths and file types, including its rejection of symlinks.

Passing a Skill format validator proves neither FLOW package validity nor execution support.
The receiver must qualify the required runtime, resources, dependencies, and powers.

## Recipe and interpreter limits

Root-level lowercase `flow` fences acquire recipe meaning in `FLOW.md`.
Quote or nest a displayed recipe when it is only an example.
Resource prose cannot register new recipes, slots, or tools.

| Profile bound | Current limit |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown body | 256 KiB |
| Aggregate loaded-resource text | 1 MiB |
| Reasoning calls | At most 32 |

Loaded resource text remains retained rather than silently summarized.
See [Markdown/0 profile bounds](../spec/markdown-runtime.md#lifecycle-profile-and-bounds) for the complete limits.

## Check the task and its constraints

Check four things separately: package validity, execution qualification, task achievement, and preservation of required constraints.
A `done` result establishes neither a correct answer nor compliance with every prose instruction.
Validate the result and evidence that matter to the task.

A required effect may be moved into an authorized code specialist and called through a declared dependency.
That produces an adapted method, whose host must support the selected implementations.
The [interpreter experiments](../evidence/skills.md) record bounded results and remaining questions.
