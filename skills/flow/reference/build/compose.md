# Compose methods

Call another Flow when it supplies a useful capability your method can build on.
The caller provides input and consumes the child's outcome and result.
The host selects and authorizes the implementation behind the declared dependency.

This tutorial builds on the [first-run classifier](https://flow.jig.md/start/run.md).
It creates an illustrative `prepare-review` method that combines the request and classification into a review record.
The review flag is this example's application policy.

## Declare the dependency

From the first-run project, scaffold the caller:

```sh
jig new prepare-review
```

Save this as `flows/prepare-review/FLOW.meta.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "prepare-review",
  "description": "Prepare a request and queue suggestion for review.",
  "uses": { "classifier": {} }
}
```

`classifier` is a local dependency name, called a slot.
It describes a capability the caller needs.
The host binds that slot to an implementation before invocation.

## Call the method

Replace `flows/prepare-review/FLOW.ts` with:

```ts
import { handle } from "@jigging/flow";

await handle(async (run) => {
  const classification = await run.call({
    operationId: "classify:1",
    slot: "classifier",
    input: run.input,
  });
  return {
    outcome: "done",
    output: {
      request: run.input,
      classification: {
        outcome: classification.outcome,
        output: classification.output,
      },
      reviewRequired: true,
    },
  };
});
```

The SDK returns the complete child result, including `outcome` and `output`.
This caller retains both values in the review record.
Its own `done` outcome means that the record is ready for review.
[Handle the classifier's outcome](outcomes.md) before acting on its suggestion.

`operationId` identifies this operation within the invocation.
Await the call before returning so the caller accounts for the work it started.
[Run/0](../spec/run-protocol.md#6-operation-identity) defines exact identity and replay rules.

## Bind and run on Jig

Create `bindings/prepare-review.ts`:

```ts
import { defineBinding } from "@jigging/jig";

export default defineBinding({
  package: "./flows/prepare-review",
  slots: { classifier: "flow:flows/classify-request" },
});
```

This Binding is Jig's configuration, separate from the portable Flow package.
Another host supplies its own way to select the dependency.

Review the change, approve the intended source and grants, then run the Binding:

```sh
jig review --allow-resolution-network
jig run binding:prepare-review --input '{"message":"I was charged twice."}' --json
```

The method result is:

```json
{
  "outcome": "done",
  "output": {
    "request": { "message": "I was charged twice." },
    "classification": {
      "outcome": "done",
      "output": { "queue": "billing" }
    },
    "reviewRequired": true
  }
}
```

Supply `{"message":12}` to exercise the classifier's invalid-input path.
The invocation fails instead of preparing a successful review record.

## Change the implementation

Use the Agent-enabled `flow-instructions` project from [Bring a Skill](skills.md) for the Markdown variation.
Open that project and scaffold a caller:

```sh
jig new prepare-review
```

Replace its `FLOW.ts` and `FLOW.meta.json` with the caller and declaration above.
Keep the package's generated SDK declaration.
Create `bindings/prepare-review.ts` with the Markdown target:

```ts
import { defineBinding } from "@jigging/jig";

export default defineBinding({
  package: "./flows/prepare-review",
  slots: { classifier: "flow:flows/classify-request-markdown" },
});
```

That project supplies the Markdown interpreter's Agent through its configured default provider.
Review the source and grants, then run the Binding:

```sh
jig review --allow-resolution-network
jig run binding:prepare-review --input '{"message":"I was charged twice."}' --timeout 4m --json
```

The caller's code stays unchanged while the selected implementation uses instructions.
Compare its suggestions against representative messages before relying on them.

The common interface lets callers compose implementations whose costs, powers, and judgment can differ.
Use [design guidance](design.md) to decide which capabilities deserve their own boundaries.
